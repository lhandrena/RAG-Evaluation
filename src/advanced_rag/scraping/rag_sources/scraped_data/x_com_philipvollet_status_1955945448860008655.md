My team just dropped Elysia, and it's not just an incremental successor to Verba… It's a whole rethink of how we interact with our data using AI.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗘𝗹𝘆𝗶𝘀𝗮?
An open-source platform for building agentic RAG architectures. It learns from your preferences, intelligently categorizes, labels, and searches through your data, and provides complete transparency into its decision-making process.

The long & exciting feature list:

• 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: Elysia’s core is a customizable decision tree, and it visualizes its entire reasoning process, showing you why it chooses a specific tool or path.

It enables advanced error handling, self-healing from failed queries, and prevents infinite loops. You can also add custom tools and branches to build complex, state-aware workflows.

• 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Before it even attempts a query, Elysia performs a full analysis of your data collections. This eliminates the blind search problem plaguing most RAG systems and allows for far more complex and accurate query generation.

• 𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝘀: Your RAG pipeline shouldn't be limited to text, right? That’s why Elysia analyzes each query's results and chooses the best way to display them, from tables and charts to product cards and GitHub tickets. It also features a comprehensive data explorer with search, sorting, and filtering capabilities.

• 𝗛𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗿-𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘃𝗶𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸: It uses your positively-rated queries as few-shot examples to improve future responses. This allows you to use smaller, faster models that perform like larger ones over time, cutting costs without sacrificing quality for most use cases.

• 𝗖𝗵𝘂𝗻𝗸-𝗢𝗻-𝗗𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱: Elysia chunks documents at query time. It performs initial searches on document-level vectors and only chunks relevant documents on the fly, storing them in a parallel quantized collection with cross references for future use.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸
Elysia is built from scratch on Weaviate, using its native features like named vectors, a variety of search types, filters, cross references, quantization, etc. It uses DSPy for LLM interactions and is delivered as a production-ready application via FastAPI, serving a NextJS frontend as static HTML.

Also available as a Python package via pip:

An open-source platform for building agentic RAG architectures. It learns from your preferences, intelligently categorizes, labels, and searches through your data, and provides complete transparency into its decision-making process.

The long & exciting feature list:

• 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻-𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: Elysia’s core is a customizable decision tree, and it visualizes its entire reasoning process, showing you why it chooses a specific tool or path.

It enables advanced error handling, self-healing from failed queries, and prevents infinite loops. You can also add custom tools and branches to build complex, state-aware workflows.

• 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Before it even attempts a query, Elysia performs a full analysis of your data collections. This eliminates the blind search problem plaguing most RAG systems and allows for far more complex and accurate query generation.

• 𝗗𝘆𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝘀: Your RAG pipeline shouldn't be limited to text, right? That’s why Elysia analyzes each query's results and chooses the best way to display them, from tables and charts to product cards and GitHub tickets. It also features a comprehensive data explorer with search, sorting, and filtering capabilities.

• 𝗛𝘆𝗽𝗲𝗿-𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘃𝗶𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸: It uses your positively-rated queries as few-shot examples to improve future responses. This allows you to use smaller, faster models that perform like larger ones over time, cutting costs without sacrificing quality for most use cases.

• 𝗖𝗵𝘂𝗻𝗸-𝗢𝗻-𝗗𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱: Elysia chunks documents at query time. It performs initial searches on document-level vectors and only chunks relevant documents on the fly, storing them in a parallel quantized collection with cross references for future use.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸
Elysia is built from scratch on Weaviate, using its native features like named vectors, a variety of search types, filters, cross references, quantization, etc. It uses DSPy for LLM interactions and is delivered as a production-ready application via FastAPI, serving a NextJS frontend as static HTML.

Also available as a Python package via pip:

Philip Vollet@philipvolletThis will retire 90% of RAG systems with dignity (and a sad song playlist). Powered by DSPy: If you're still building "text in, text out" chatbots that only perform blind vector and text searches, you're not gonna make it!
