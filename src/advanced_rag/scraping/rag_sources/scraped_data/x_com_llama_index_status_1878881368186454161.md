For LlamaIndex users, this is particularly interesting because it systematically evaluates different RAG techniques and components that you might be using or considering in your applications.

Some interesting findings:Hybrid retrieval methods (combining BM25 and vector search) often outperformed pure vector or BM25 approachesQuery expansion wasn't always beneficial - it depends on your use caseSome rerankers actually performed worse than no reranking - suggesting you should test before implementingSimple approaches sometimes outperform more complex ones

The paper covers evaluation techniques and includes the data sets they used.
