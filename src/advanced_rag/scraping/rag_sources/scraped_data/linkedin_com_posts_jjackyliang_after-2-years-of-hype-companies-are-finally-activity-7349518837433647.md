# Vector search hype is over: Claude Code beats Cursor | ü§ñ Jacky Liang posted on the topic | LinkedIn

Vector search hype is over: Claude Code beats CursorThis title was summarized by AI from the post below.ü§ñ Jacky Liang‚úçüèª always learning // ai @ tigerdata && founder answerhq.co // pinecone, oracle cloud, singlestore, looker (acq. google)3moReport this postAfter 2 years of hype, companies are finally realizing vector search doesn't solve everything. The 2023 investment peak is over, and the downturn is brutal.

The core problem: similarity != relevance

When you search for getUserById(), you need that exact function. Not findUserByEmail() or updateUserProfile(). Vector search gives you "semantically similar" - which is completely useless for code.

Same with part numbers, SKUs, or any identifier. "P/N 4B0-959-855-A" isn't meaningful text - it's a reference. Vector search returning "4B0-959-855-B" will cost you real money.

Case in point: Claude Code is eating Cursor's lunch

While Cursor forces you to manually tag files with @ symbols, Claude Code finds the right context automatically using good old grep - a 50-year-old utility that actually works. 

Biggest tell that Cursor is feeling the heat? Cursor just hired two Claude Code leads (Boris and Cat). They see the writing on the wall.

Things to takeaway from this: 
- AI isn't about fancy vector databases. It's just search. And sometimes the oldest tools are still the best.
- Stop defaulting to "AI = vector database." Choose the right tool for the job:
Code search? Lexical matching
- Intent understanding? Semantic similarity
- E-commerce? Both

The industry is finally growing up. One-size-fits-all solutions are dead.

Why would anyone use vector search to find exact match on identifiers? That makes no sense. 
However if you do need to search in a vector space vector databases are amazing. I have used them for a multitude of production usecases since long before any of this hype. There is a lot of usecases where similarity is a great approximation of relevance. If not you need to learn another representation. 
And there is no such thing as ‚ÄúJust search‚Äù. Search is a hard, multifaceted problem that usually needs more thought than just using off the shelf similarity or hard coded matches.
