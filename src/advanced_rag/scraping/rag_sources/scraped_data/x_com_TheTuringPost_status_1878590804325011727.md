Let's explore how@huggingface's variant of Agentic RAG works.

Its idea is to transform users' queries into retrieval-friendly statements, critique and retry retrieval, making the system more autonomous and accurate.

So the workflow of Agentic RAG includes:

- Reformulating queries in an affirmative form.
- Searches the database for top-k relevant documents.
- Returning the retrieved content for further analysis. Agentic RAG refines the query and repeats the whole process until it achieves necessary results.
- Finally, if everything is right, Agentic RAG combines the info with the user query and LLM generates the answer.

What pros and cons does this system have?
