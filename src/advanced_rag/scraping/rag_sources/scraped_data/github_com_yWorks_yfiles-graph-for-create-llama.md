yFiles Integration for Knowledge Graph Exploration

## yFiles Integration for Knowledge Graph Exploration

This integration with yFiles then allows you to visualize the specific nodes involved in generating answers within a knowledge graph. You can easily identify which nodes contribute to an answer and further explore the graph by expanding neighboring nodes for a broader context.

Understand How LlamaIndex Constructs Answers

### Understand How LlamaIndex Constructs Answers

With this tool, you can gain deeper insights into how LlamaIndex processes information. It showcases the data from source nodes used to create a final answer. By visualizing the flow from source nodes to answers, you can better understand the logic behind the results and interactively explore the connections in the knowledge graph.

Before beginning the project, ensure you add your agent specifications to a.envfile located in the backend folder.
Alternatively, you can modify the.env_templatefile located in the backend and rename it to.env.

To use this template, first obtain a freeyFiles for HTML evaluation package(note theyfilesdependency infrontent/package.json) then add your OpenAI key and uncomment the line marked with aTODO.

```
frontent/package.json
```

Then startup the backend as described in thebackend READMEand start the development server of the frontend as described in thefrontend README.

Openhttp://localhost:3000with your browser to see the result.

To view a graph, submit a question related to the files you have uploaded.
To expand a node, simply double-click on it. A node will only expand if there are hidden neighboring nodes available to reveal.
