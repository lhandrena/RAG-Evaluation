corpus into chunks, ranks them by similarity, and retrieves the most relevant text for generating responses.Knowledge-based
GraphRAGextracts detailed knowledge graphs from the corpus using entity recognition and relation extraction, offering
fine-grained, domain-specific information.Index-based GraphRAGsummarizes the corpus into high-level topic nodes, which
are linked to form an index graph, while the fact linking maps topics to text.RAG vs. GraphRAGGraphRAG is a new paradigm of RAG that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications, by addressing traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations:(i) graph-structured knowledge representationthat explicitly captures
entity relationships and domain hierarchies,(ii) graph-aware retrieval mechanismsthat enable multi-hop reasoning and context-preserving knowledge acquisition, and(iii) structure-guided
knowledge search algorithmsthat ensure efficient retrieval across large-scale corpora.Comparison between traditional RAG and GraphRAG.üì´ Contact UsWe welcome researchers to share related work to enrich this list or provide insightful comments on our survey.

corpus into chunks, ranks them by similarity, and retrieves the most relevant text for generating responses.Knowledge-based
GraphRAGextracts detailed knowledge graphs from the corpus using entity recognition and relation extraction, offering
fine-grained, domain-specific information.Index-based GraphRAGsummarizes the corpus into high-level topic nodes, which
are linked to form an index graph, while the fact linking maps topics to text.RAG vs. GraphRAGGraphRAG is a new paradigm of RAG that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications, by addressing traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations:(i) graph-structured knowledge representationthat explicitly captures
entity relationships and domain hierarchies,(ii) graph-aware retrieval mechanismsthat enable multi-hop reasoning and context-preserving knowledge acquisition, and(iii) structure-guided
knowledge search algorithmsthat ensure efficient retrieval across large-scale corpora.Comparison between traditional RAG and GraphRAG.üì´ Contact UsWe welcome researchers to share related work to enrich this list or provide insightful comments on our survey.

corpus into chunks, ranks them by similarity, and retrieves the most relevant text for generating responses.Knowledge-based
GraphRAGextracts detailed knowledge graphs from the corpus using entity recognition and relation extraction, offering
fine-grained, domain-specific information.Index-based GraphRAGsummarizes the corpus into high-level topic nodes, which
are linked to form an index graph, while the fact linking maps topics to text.RAG vs. GraphRAGGraphRAG is a new paradigm of RAG that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications, by addressing traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations:(i) graph-structured knowledge representationthat explicitly captures
entity relationships and domain hierarchies,(ii) graph-aware retrieval mechanismsthat enable multi-hop reasoning and context-preserving knowledge acquisition, and(iii) structure-guided
knowledge search algorithmsthat ensure efficient retrieval across large-scale corpora.Comparison between traditional RAG and GraphRAG.üì´ Contact UsWe welcome researchers to share related work to enrich this list or provide insightful comments on our survey.

corpus into chunks, ranks them by similarity, and retrieves the most relevant text for generating responses.Knowledge-based
GraphRAGextracts detailed knowledge graphs from the corpus using entity recognition and relation extraction, offering
fine-grained, domain-specific information.Index-based GraphRAGsummarizes the corpus into high-level topic nodes, which
are linked to form an index graph, while the fact linking maps topics to text.RAG vs. GraphRAGGraphRAG is a new paradigm of RAG that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications, by addressing traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations:(i) graph-structured knowledge representationthat explicitly captures
entity relationships and domain hierarchies,(ii) graph-aware retrieval mechanismsthat enable multi-hop reasoning and context-preserving knowledge acquisition, and(iii) structure-guided
knowledge search algorithmsthat ensure efficient retrieval across large-scale corpora.Comparison between traditional RAG and GraphRAG.üì´ Contact UsWe welcome researchers to share related work to enrich this list or provide insightful comments on our survey.

GraphRAGextracts detailed knowledge graphs from the corpus using entity recognition and relation extraction, offering
fine-grained, domain-specific information.Index-based GraphRAGsummarizes the corpus into high-level topic nodes, which
are linked to form an index graph, while the fact linking maps topics to text.RAG vs. GraphRAGGraphRAG is a new paradigm of RAG that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications, by addressing traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations:(i) graph-structured knowledge representationthat explicitly captures
entity relationships and domain hierarchies,(ii) graph-aware retrieval mechanismsthat enable multi-hop reasoning and context-preserving knowledge acquisition, and(iii) structure-guided
knowledge search algorithmsthat ensure efficient retrieval across large-scale corpora.Comparison between traditional RAG and GraphRAG.üì´ Contact UsWe welcome researchers to share related work to enrich this list or provide insightful comments on our survey.

Overview of traditional RAG and two typical GraphRAG workflows.

Non-graph RAGorganizes the
corpus into chunks, ranks them by similarity, and retrieves the most relevant text for generating responses.

Knowledge-based
GraphRAGextracts detailed knowledge graphs from the corpus using entity recognition and relation extraction, offering
fine-grained, domain-specific information.

Index-based GraphRAGsummarizes the corpus into high-level topic nodes, which
are linked to form an index graph, while the fact linking maps topics to text.

GraphRAG is a new paradigm of RAG that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications, by addressing traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations:(i) graph-structured knowledge representationthat explicitly captures
entity relationships and domain hierarchies,(ii) graph-aware retrieval mechanismsthat enable multi-hop reasoning and context-preserving knowledge acquisition, and(iii) structure-guided
knowledge search algorithmsthat ensure efficient retrieval across large-scale corpora.
