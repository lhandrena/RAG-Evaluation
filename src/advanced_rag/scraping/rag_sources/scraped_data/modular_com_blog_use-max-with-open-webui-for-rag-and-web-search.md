Modular Agentic Cookbook

# Modular Agentic Cookbook

A collection of recipes demonstrating how to build modern fullstack web apps using Modular MAX, Next.js, and the Vercel AI SDK. Each recipe demonstrates an end-to-end workflow with both frontend and backend implementations, including detailed code comments.

ðŸ“¦ Looking for legacy recipes?Older standalone recipes have been moved to thearchive/folder. These are provided as-is for historical reference only and are no longer maintained.

Node.js22.x or higher

Build a streaming chat interface that maintains conversation context across multiple exchanges. This recipe demonstrates:

Real-time token streaming using the Vercel AI SDK

Markdown rendering with syntax-highlighted code blocks using Streamdown

Auto-scrolling message display with smart scroll detection

Seamless compatibility with Modular MAX and OpenAI-compatible endpoints

Create an intelligent image captioning system that generates natural language descriptions for uploaded images with progressive streaming and performance tracking. Features include:

NDJSON streaming: Custom useNDJSON hook for progressive resultsâ€”captions appear as they're generated

Parallel processing: Multiple images processed simultaneously for maximum speed

Performance metrics: TTFT (time to first token) and duration tracking

Drag-and-drop image upload with Mantine Dropzone

Customizable prompt for caption generation

Gallery view with loading states and real-time updates

The cookbook is organized as a pnpm workspace monorepo with a clean separation between the Next.js app and shared recipe implementations:

â”œâ”€â”€ apps/cookbook/           # Next.js 14 App
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/                 # App Router pages & API routes

```

For a deep dive into the architecture, see theArchitecture Guide.

Create a directory underpackages/recipes/src/your-recipe-name/with:

```
packages/recipes/src/your-recipe-name/
```

ui.tsx- Frontend React component with inline documentation

api.ts- Backend API handler using Vercel AI SDK

Each recipe follows consistent patterns: React hooks for state management, Mantine UI components, and detailed inline comments explaining architecture decisions and data flow.

For detailed instructions, see theContributing Guide.

Start MAX model serving (see quickstart):

max serve --model google/gemma-3-27b-it

```
max serve --model google/gemma-3-27b-it
```

Configure the endpoint in.env.localand select it in the cookbook UI. The cookbook works with MAX or any OpenAI-compatible API.

The cookbook can run entirely in Docker with MAX model serving included. Build with:

docker build --ulimit nofile=65535:65535 -t max-cookbook:latest.

```
docker build --ulimit nofile=65535:65535 -t max-cookbook:latest.
```

Run with GPU support (NVIDIA example):

docker run --gpus all \
    -v~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    -e"HF_TOKEN=your-token"\
    -e"MAX_MODEL=mistral-community/pixtral-12b"\
    -p 8000:8000 -p 3000:3000 \
    max-cookbook:latest

```
docker run --gpus all \
    -v~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    -e"HF_TOKEN=your-token"\
    -e"MAX_MODEL=mistral-community/pixtral-12b"\
    -p 8000:8000 -p 3000:3000 \
    max-cookbook:latest
```

"HF_TOKEN=your-token"

"MAX_MODEL=mistral-community/pixtral-12b"

The container supports both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. For detailed instructions including AMD setup, build arguments, and troubleshooting, see theDocker Guide.

pnpm dev- Start development server with hot reloading (uses Turbopack)

pnpm build- Build production-optimized bundle

pnpm start- Run production server

pnpm lint- Run ESLint checks

pnpm format- Format code with Prettier

pnpm format:check- Check code formatting

The best way to learn is by running the cookbook and exploring the recipes. Toggle "Show Code" in the UI to see implementations alongside demos. Each recipe contains extensive inline documentation explaining architecture decisions and integration patterns.

Contributions welcome! Fork the repo, create a feature branch, follow established patterns, and submit a pull request. Ensure proper TypeScript types and comprehensive inline documentation.
