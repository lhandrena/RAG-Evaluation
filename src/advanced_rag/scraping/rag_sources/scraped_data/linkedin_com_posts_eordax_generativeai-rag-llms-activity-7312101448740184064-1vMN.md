Eduardo Ordax’s PostEduardo Ordax🤖 Generative AI Lead @ AWS ☁️ (150k+) | Startup Advisor | Public Speaker | AI Outsider | Founder Thinkfluencer AI6moReport this postMy Go-To Guide for Advanced RAG Techniques!

When it comes to GenAI, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)—alongside code generation—is one of the most impactful and widely adopted use cases.

Why? Because nearly every company has internal knowledge that needs to be injected into LLMs to provide external context. And since RAG is relatively easy to get started with at a small scale, everyone’s working on it.

But going from a simple proof-of-concept to a production-ready RAG pipeline requires more than just connecting a few docs to an LLM.

It starts with choosing your vector DB—and while there are many great options out there,Weaviateis my personal favorite. From there, things get real:

✔️Implement it in the cloud
✔️Set up permissions
✔️Treat your vector DB like your data lake—centralized and strategic, not fragmented by use case

Once that’s in place, you’ll likely begin with basic RAG. But to truly improve performance and accuracy, you’ll need to move into advanced strategies for:

✔️Chunking
✔️Indexing
✔️Retrieval
✔️Generation

And of course, none of it works without a robust evaluation framework to continuously validate and refine your outputs.

This RAG cheat sheet pulls it all together—a must-have for anyone looking to scale RAG with confidence.#GenerativeAI#RAG#LLMs#VectorDB#AI1,14641 CommentsLikeCommentRajdeep SahaBestselling Author & Educator | Former Principal Solutions Architect @AWS | YouTuber (100K+) | Public Speaker | Tech Advisor6moReport this commentThe RAG pipelines are great advice here, starting simple, building it out carefully, and then thoroughly testing.
